## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Model Loading Errors
**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ultralytics'`
```bash
# Solution
pip install ultralytics>=8.0.0
pip install torch>=2.0.0
```

**Problem**: Model file not found
```bash
# Solution: Verify model path
ls -la models/bloomshield_yolov8m_high_accuracy_fixed.pt
# If missing, download from releases
```

#### 2. Memory Issues
**Problem**: Out of memory during prediction
```python
# Solution: Reduce batch size or image size
# In app.py, modify image preprocessing:
MAX_IMAGE_SIZE = (640, 640)  # Reduce from default
```

#### 3. Slow Performance
**Problem**: Predictions taking >5 seconds
```bash
# Solutions:
# 1. Ensure CPU optimization
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# 2. Check system resources
htop  # Linux/Mac
# Task Manager on Windows

# 3. Enable model caching (already implemented)
```

#### 4. Upload Issues
**Problem**: File upload fails
```javascript
// Check file size and format
if (file.size > 10 * 1024 * 1024) {
    alert('File too large (max 10MB)');
}
if (!['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png'].includes(file.type)) {
    alert('Invalid file format');
}
```

### 🛠️ Development Issues

#### 1. Database Problems
```bash
# Reset database
rm community_uploads.db
python -c "from app import setup_database; setup_database()"
```

#### 2. Port Conflicts
```bash
# Use different port
export PORT=5001
python app.py
# Or specify in code: app.run(port=5001)
```

#### 3. CORS Issues (Development)
```python
# Add to app.py for development only
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)
```
